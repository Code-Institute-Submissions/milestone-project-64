# Milestone-project

This is a personal portfolio site intendet to show future employers my work and what I can do.
The site is very simplistic and easy to use.
 
## Features

The site consists of three pages
*Home - Simple welcome page to show which languages I can work with.
*Resume - CV to tell about myself and previous job experiences.
*Contact - Easy to use contact form to get in touch with me.
 
### Existing Features

The only feature for the moment is the
- Contact form

### Features Left to Implement

Future implementations include
- Make the contact form working
- Add additional contact information
- Include a download link for CV and personal letter
- Adding future projects in a showcase section

## Technologies Used

The site is constructed with
#### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
#### Tools
- Gitpod
- Github
- Notepad++

HTML was used for the functionality and content. CSS for the design of the page. Gitpod was used to write and edit the code and Github to hold the repository. And Notepad++ to work away from github and try other platforms.

## Testing

I have tested that the site responds to different screen sizes.
The contact form need no testing because it does not have any back end functionally to it.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Content

- At this point I have only used filler text (ipsum lorum), except for titles and headings.
